# Predicting backorder for inverntory management

In this project, I will use python to predict orders that moved to back order for inventory management analysis.
I will use random forest model to predict this. The data set comes from kaggle as a two seprate csv files. 
First, I will upload and clean the data, scale the features, and use random forest machine learning prediction to predict backorders.
